/*
 * The allocator maintains a memory reserve that is used to satisfy allocation
 * requests when no additional memory can be acquired from the operating
 * system.  Under normal operating conditions, the reserve size is at least
 * reserve_min bytes.  If the reserve is depleted or insufficient to satisfy an
 * allocation request, then condition notifications are sent to one or more of
 * the registered callback functions:
 *
 *   RESERVE_CND_LOW: The reserve had to be used to satisfy an allocation
 *                    request, which dropped the reserve size below the
 *                    minimum.  The callee should try to free memory in order
 *                    to restore the reserve.
 *
 *   RESERVE_CND_CRIT: The reserve was not large enough to satisfy a pending
 *                     allocation request.  Some callee must free adequate
 *                     memory in order to prevent application failure (unless
 *                     the condition spontaneously desists due to concurrent
 *                     deallocation).
 *
 *   RESERVE_CND_FAIL: An allocation request could not be satisfied, despite all
 *                     attempts.  The allocator is about to terminate the
 *                     application.
 *
 * The order in which the callback functions are called is only loosely
 * specified: in the absence of interposing callback
 * registrations/unregistrations, enabled callbacks will be called in an
 * arbitrary round-robin order.
 *
 * Condition notifications are sent to callbacks only while conditions exist.
 * For example, just before the allocator sends a RESERVE_CND_LOW condition
 * notification to a callback, the reserve is in fact depleted.  However, due
 * to allocator concurrency, the reserve may have been restored by the time the
 * callback function executes.  Furthermore, if the reserve is restored at some
 * point during the delivery of condition notifications to callbacks, no
 * further deliveries will occur, since the condition no longer exists.
 *
 * Callback functions can freely call back into the allocator (i.e. the
 * allocator releases all internal resources before calling each callback
 * function), though allocation is discouraged, since recursive callbacks are
 * likely to result, which places extra burden on the application to avoid
 * deadlock.
 *
 * Callback functions must be thread-safe, since it is possible that multiple
 * threads will call into the same callback function concurrently.
